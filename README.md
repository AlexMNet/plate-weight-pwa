# Plate Weight

Live link: [Plate Weight](https://plate-weight-8d3ba.web.app/)

This application is a plate calculator that displays the plates needed on a barbell for a given weight. This application was originally written in React Native [Repo](https://github.com/AlexMNet/plateCalculator-React_Native) but I have since migrated this over to an installable PWA since I wanted it to be available on any device.

The initial scope of this app was to only build what is present in tab1. Just the plate calculator but has since grown to include more features with more features in progress.
